csle, short for "Chinese String Literal Expression", diagnoses whether the string literal expression contains Chinese characters, and can quickly fix them between simplified or traditional glyphs.

In the extension settings view, you can exclude strings in certain locations, such as print, if you don't want to diagnose them.

In the extension settings view, you can modify the Chinese characters glyphs you want to diagnose and the glyphs to quickly fix.
